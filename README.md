### ***Description***
#### Why a simple browser memory game you may ask? I wanted to make something that would relax me after having a very intense, busy week. And it worked - I had lots of fun making this! I mean, who doesn't like to look at cute kitties? I drew all of them myself with an S Pen and very simple editor. Drawing is like meditation for me. So if you're looking for a short break to take things of your mind you are in the right place! I hope you will enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed making it! 

### ***Technologies***
### JavaScript, CSS, HTML
